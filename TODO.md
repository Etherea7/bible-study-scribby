## Debugs
1. Import JSON toast text is really hard to see, fix the font so that it is easy to see. Using light colored text on light colored background is not really smart... This is for both green and red toasts (positive and negative responses), both are hard to see fix this. Even the tooltip text is hard to see, the one that says "Export your saved studies as JSON ..."
2. Scrolling/animations are very buggy and low fps (performance) though it works, example is the settings modal. Think of ways to optimize the frontend components so its smooth.




## Production System Architecture
1. Chatbot to ask questions about the Study (whole different thing)
2. Collaboration Studies - Real Time edits like Google Docs. (Need to look into this)
3. If its good, provision database for people to store and share their studies.
