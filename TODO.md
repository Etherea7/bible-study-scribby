## Functional Changes
1. Allow users to edit the questions and sample answers and save the study as an artefact or something in the browser, then allow them the autonomy to save the study when they want to.
 - Allow for additional AI calls for functions as such as generate questions, generate sample answers.
 - Have a study flow/main as an additional column so the user can see what the questions are there for and how they can direct. Allow the user to edit the flow as they please as if its an artefact and this would data being dynamic, would be used for the aforementioned AI functions as context to generate questions etc.
2. Need to test the history function whether the data actually persists during deployment.
3. Right now you can export JSON but how can you import it??? LOL and how can we verify the if its a valid JSON.
4. Provide rules for the Ai, making sure it doesn't generate anything that is false doctrine and is faithful to the gospel.

## UI Changes
1. Select a Passage padding very ugly
2. Book, Passage, Chapter, Verse selector UI quite ugly and the button to generate study guide is weirdly flushed to the left, could have a more fun-themed button to generate.
3. Recent Studies Component has bad padding as well. 
4. Individual recent studies in history component is not very nice.
5. Back button from history is not very nice.
6. Insert a short descrition indicating that this is for expository, and the user should thoroughly check and pray when doing the study/prepping the study guide, making sure to discern.
